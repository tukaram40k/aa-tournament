# About
Astrologer determines whether to cooperate or defect based on the Astral Threads of Destiny. It looks to the Cosmos for guidance, and predicts opponent's move based on the movement of Celestial Bodies.

Astrologer performes divination in the following way:

* One of the three Rules of Fate is chosen - rule of element, rule of day and night, and rule of hemisphere
* Opponent's Zodiac Sign is determined
* Based on Rule of Fate and opponent's Zodiac Sign, a prediction is made
* Based on prediction, cooperation or defection is chosen

Since astrologer is able to predict the future, it will always win and is absolutely unbeatable (unless it's raining outside and you can't see the stars).
